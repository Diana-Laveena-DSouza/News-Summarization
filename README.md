# Problem Statement
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Making news is hard enough, even if you don’t think about tight deadlines and thorough fact-checking. A news piece must meet specific editorial criteria, such as accuracy, timeliness, and availability of sources. 
On its own - writing a news piece is not a big deal. But there is a lot of stuff going on in the world. And the reality is that a news media platform must deliver news in time to remain competitive and engage with the target audience.  Thus, Text Summarization is a cost-effective and time-saving option for the media and journalists. Think about it as a helping hand for the journalist.
